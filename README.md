# DSSG tutorial: Introduction to convolutional neural network for computer vision

This is the tutorial session for [Stanford Data Science for Social Good](https://datascience.stanford.edu/programs/data-science-social-good-summer-program). We use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/) to interactively execute the code and visualize the training result. 

In this tutorial, you will: 
1. Understand how the convolutional neural networks (CNN) work
2. Implement CNN using Tensorflow and Keras
3. Train your CNN on CIFAR-10
4. Visualize the performance of your trained CNN
5. Learn how to do transfer learning
